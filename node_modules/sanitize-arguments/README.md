![sanitize-arguments — Order arguments with ease!](http://i.imgur.com/SAhDs.png)

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/silvinci/node-sanitize-arguments.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silvinci/node-sanitize-arguments)

```javascript
var sanitize = require("sanitize-arguments");

function Person(name, birthdate, size, pets, ability) {
  var args = sanitize(arguments, Person, [String, Date, Number, Array, Function]);
  
  // Now we can be sure that all arguments are in the right order
  this.properties = {
    name: args.name,
    birthdate: args.birthdate,
    size: args.size,
    pets: args.pets,
    ability: args.ability
  };
  
  console.log(this.properties);
}

// Even if someone totally fucks up the order and leaves out some arguments
new Person("silvinci", 180, ["dog", "cat"]);
// we still get the right order:
// { name: "silvinci", size: 180, pets: ["dog", "cat"], birthdate: undefined, ability: undefined }
```

Installation
============

Just grab it with the awesome npm.

    $ npm install sanitize-arguments

Or clone the repository.

    $ git clone git://github.com/silvinci/node-sanitize-arguments

Usage
=====

There are two ways of using `sanitize`. The example above shows the first (and prefered) one.
The first argument is your `arguments` object, which contains all supplied values passed to the function.
The second one is the `Function` itself. The third one is an `Array` of `Types` or `Objects`
indicating the desired order. It's similiar to Java's `function(String name, Date birthdate, ...)`.
We just take our "strong types" out of the warehouse and put them into `sanitize`.

When giving these three `arguments` to `sanitize` it will return an object where all the values are
paired with their correct variable name and undefined values stay undefined, like so:
```javascript
{
  name: "silvinci",
  birthdate: undefined,
  size: 180,
  pets: ["dog", "cat"],
  ability: undefined
}
```
It *also* effectively changes the `arguments` object, thus altering the `function`'s variables aswell.
But this doesn't work in every case. First of all: This won't work in strict mode, because the magic link
between `arguments` and its variables is disabled. You also have to make sure that you *always* apply
the full count of arguments when calling your function, since only defined variables can be changed
via `arguments`.

Only when you can be sure, that you're code won't ever run in strict mode and your function *always*
gets called with the full count of arguments, that may be swapt, then you can use `sanitize` in
another, even more comfortable way.
```javascript
function test(a, b, c, d, e)
  sanitize(arguments, [String, Date, Number, Array, Function]);
  console.log(a, b, c, d, e);
}
```

Using the magic link the variables are changed and you don't have to use the returned object.
Please note, that `sanitize` will still return an object: the altered `arguments` so you could
acces the arguments by `returned[0]` too.

Extras
======

`sanitize` comes with some extra sugar for you. It exposes the typechecks it uses itself.
- `typeOf(object)` is a `typeof` like you would expect it to be.
  For instance `typeOf([])` returns "Array" and not "object", like 'typeof []' does.
- `nameOf(Function)` returns a function's name. Useful for passed in functions.
- `argsOf(Function)` returns an array of the expected arguments.
